Hi User,

This is to give some guidelines to run code.

* The code having usage of below libraries.
	-python 
	-pandas
	-matplotlib
	If system asks you to download any other libraries to run please install simply(If I missed).

* The code can be run from local system like in command prompt or IDLE system file or any python software(like Jupyter).
  I have attached the sample code from Jupyter notebook environment.


*The Excel file for dataset is attached and you can give the file path in the code to run.

*The sample code and output is attached in the word file for your reference and to give you an overview.

*The code will ask you to enter any location in the list and based on the location
 the average of the all the years(here 22 years given) are calculated monthwise and charts will be created.

please let me know if you feel something is not on track.
